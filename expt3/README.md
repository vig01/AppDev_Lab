# Experiment 3: Setting up Android Studio and Creating a Simple Counter App

## Aim
To set up **Android Studio** and create a simple **Counter App** that can **increase, decrease, and reset** a number using buttons.

## Steps Followed
1. Installed **Android Studio** and created a new project with an **Empty Activity**.
2. Named the project `CounterApp` and selected **Java** as the programming language.
3. Designed the **UI** in `activity_main.xml`:
   - Added a `TextView` to display the count.
   - Added three `Button`s: Increase, Decrease, Reset.
   - Used `ConstraintLayout` and `TableLayout` for alignment.
4. Implemented the logic in `MainActivity.java`:
   - Initialized `TextView` and `Button`s using `findViewById`.
   - Set `OnClickListener` for each button:
     - **Increase:** Adds 1 to the current value.
     - **Decrease:** Subtracts 1 (if value > 0).
     - **Reset:** Sets the value to 0.
5. Tested the app on an **Android emulator** or **real device** to ensure buttons work correctly.


## Source Code
- [MainActivity.java](./MainActivity.java)  
- [activity_main.xml](./activity_main.xml)  

## Expected Output
- **Initial screen:** Displays `0` in the TextView.  
- **Press "Increase":** Count increases by 1 each time.  
- **Press "Decrease":** Count decreases by 1 (minimum 0).  
- **Press "Reset":** Count resets to `0`.
